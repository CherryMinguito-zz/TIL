Link: https://github.com/97-things/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/blob/master/en/SUMMARY.md

# A summary from 100 words to 200 words 
This book offers 97 short and extremely useful tips every programmer should know. These are compiled from collective wisdoms of experts in the field. Adopting new approaches to old problems and learning best practices. It does not only encompasses technical topics but also tackles about reading human as we always deal with interpersonal in our day to day tasks. Design principles and coding techniques, importance of learning skills and expertise, and professionalism, mindset and attitude are among the things discussed in this book.

# Describe three particularly impressive items in the book
⦁Content - Dont be afraid to break things.\
⦁Reason  - It is explained here that the reason in making changes is so nerve wracking is because the system is sick. But we should cut out the sick parts to make room for healing. We should always care about the general health of the project.

⦁Content - Don't Ignore that error\
⦁Reason  - Not handling errors lead to brittle, poor and insecure code. It is explained here that if there are errors that are hard to deal with, it means that we probably have a poor interface. We should express our code in a way that errors are less disturbing and less burdensome to handle.

⦁Content - Know your next commit.\
⦁Reason  - In this part, Dan Bergh Johnsson emphasized that commit focused programmers has a clear vision and with a clear purpose and a limited, achievable goal in mind in the next few hours would result to a more concrete and working output.

# List the points that have changed your mind before and after the change

**Before** <br>
I am not mindful in throwing errors before. <br>
**After** <br>
Error messages are the most critical interactions between the user and the rest of the system. This would make users annoyed therefore we should prevent it. We can handle this by providing good UI design, providing cues and defaults.<br>
**Before** <br>
I don't like reading codes. Especially my code cause I find too cluttered and I don't like how I did it. <br>
**After** <br>
It as advised in this book that we should read code and ask ourselves, Is the code easy or hard to read? If it is hard to read, why is that? This way, we can evaluate and point out what needs to be improved the next time we write code. <br>
**Before** <br>
I usually take requests literally and only try to understand the scope based on the given information. <br>
**After** <br>
I have learned that customer do not mean what they say, they might tell us the things they want in their own context which could also mean another thing to developers. We have to probe for further information so that we could come up to the same point with what the customer really want the output to be.

# Three things I learned by reading the book
- 	Comments are not evil. Comment only what the code cannot say./
-	The Boys Scout Rule. We should 'leave the campground cleaner than you found it'. If we find mess, we should clean it up regardless of who might have made the mess.
-	Learn new language. By learning new language, we will also get better understanding of design patterns by moving between different languages.

# Write one custom that you want to change based on what you have learned.

**▼What you want to change:** <br>
To always practice Boys Scout Rule. That we should perform clean up of the code regardless of who made the mess. <br>
**▼Purpose:** <br>
Our systems would gradually get better and better as they evolved. Caring for the team's code is a good thing. Teams help each other, and clean up after each other. <br>
**▼Background:** <br>
When I am assigned with tasks or bug fixing, I usually do not touch anything that is not part of what is asked/requested.  <br>
**▼Causes of Problems:**  <br>
I don't want to break things or the author might feel/think bad about someone touching his/her work. <br>
**▼Solution to The Problem:** <br>
We simply have to make the module a little bit better than when we checked it out. This will make the system become better as it evolve.
